```

## running the development server:

```bash

#THIS PROJECT REQUIRES NODE V >=20.x.x and YARN v4.0.2 

# do this before starting
yarn set version berry
#
yarn config set nodeLinker node-modules
#
yarn install
# to add packages
yarn add
#then to start the server
yarn dev
#for upgrading the packages/plugins/extensions

```




## AFTER MAKING SOME CHANGES TO THE REPO FOLLOW THE STEPS BELOW:




## FOR CONNECTING THE REMOTE REPOSITORY (in terminal)(only use if you know how to because i don't,  lol!)
```bash

git remote add origin https://github.com/bichitra-linux/medical_record_keeping_sytem.git

for more about yarn and guide of using  it visit https://v3.yarnpkg.com


## Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.



[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
